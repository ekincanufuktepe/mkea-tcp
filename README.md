# MKEA-TCP

MKEA-TCP is a mutant kill-based local search augmented evolutionary algorithm test case prioritization technique.

There are also three more techniques implemented in the code that uses: 
* Total-based approach (TMKPT)
* Additiona-based approach (AMKPT)
* Evalutionary Algorithm without local search

To run MKEA-TCP, run the `Main.java` class. You can set the mutation report file in the `Main.java` class file. There are currently 5 mutation report files generated by [Pitest](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest).
